\chapter{Conclusion}
In this chapter there is information concluding the project, such as what the group learned and experienced.
\section{New Experiences}
All members of the group learned much about teamwork, project management, planning, programming in a group, programming towards the Android platform, programming documents in LaTeX, and writing documentation for project activities.

\section{Lessons learned about Research and Prestudies}
The research provided significant benefits for the group by providing a solid knowledge base for the application domain, so time spent on research was well spent. However, in retrospect the group was able to identify some faults in their research planning, and learned some lessons about how to avoid the same mistakes in the future:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Even though the research was accurate, the group was reluctant to employ the research results in the application before they were confirmed by the health experts. As the meeting with the health experts did not take place before 22.03, the group lost valuable time waiting, time that could have been spent for implementation. The lesson learned is to rely on research results, at least until a more reliable source of information is available (in this project, the expert group).
\item
Even though research was useful in the domains that were covered, some areas that could have benefited from research were not identified during planning, and were therefore not given thorough research. Because of this, some of the customer's demands were misinterpreted at first, forcing the group to change the application architecture at a later stage. In particular, the group was unfamiliar with the standards of Android development, especially the general architecture of Content Provider. A solid foundation in this area could have aided understanding. The lesson learned is to spend more time trying to identify potential research areas. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Conflict handling}
There were no one-on-one conflicts, but some conflicts arose right after mid-term regarding work load and willingness to prioritize the project. To try to solve this the group leader communicated the issues and its potential solutions via e-mail, with no further response. Some group members took the e-mail seriously and stepped up their work load, but on the other hand some ignored this wake up call completely and did not take any action. A meeting with the supervisor was scheduled to try to get an idea to solve the situation, but was used for other purposes instead, because the group did not have an opportunity to discuss matters beforehand.
Technical disagreements were solved by discussing the possible solutions with the entire group, until all the group members agreed on a course of action.
