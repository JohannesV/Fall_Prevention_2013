\chapter{Research and Alternate Solutions}
During the planning stage, the groups was able to identify two areas which required research:
\begin{description}
\item[Domain knowledge:] No member of the group had any familiarity with the application domain, neither with the specific domain (fall studies) nor any of the related domains (like healthcare, medicine or sport science). A basic understanding of the domain is critical for communication with the expert group, as well as for the ability to develop and assess solutions independently of the expert group.
\item[Related software:] Related applications function as sources of inspiration, proofs of what is feasible to implement or even as aids during programming. Open source software can be partially or entirely incorporated into the code. Knowledge of related software can thus increase development efficiency.  
\end{description}
For each of the two areas of research, one member of the group was assigned to research and compile a concise report, so that the rest of the group could efficiently attain the required knowledge.   

The two reports will be reproduced in the following sections.

\section{Lessons learned}
The research provided significant benefits for the group by providing a solid knowledge base for the application domain, so time spent on research was well spent. However, in retrospect the group was able to identify some faults in their research planning, and learned some lessons about how to avoid the same mistakes in the future:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Even though the research were accurate, the group was reluctant to employ the research results in the application before they were confirmed by the health experts. As the meeting with the health experts did not take place before 22.03, the group lost valuable time waiting, time that could have been spent for implementation. The lesson learned is to rely on research results, at least until a more reliable source of information is available (in this project, the expert group).
\item
Even though research was useful in the domains that were covered, some areas that could have benefited from research were not identified during planning, and were therefore not given thorough research. Because of this, some of the customer's demands were misinterpreted at first, forcing the group to change the application architecture at a later stage. In particular, the group was unfamiliar with the standards of Android development, especially the general architecture of Content Provider. A solid foundation in this area could have aided understanding. The lesson learned is to spend more time trying to identify potential research areas.
