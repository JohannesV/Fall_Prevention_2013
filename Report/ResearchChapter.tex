\chapter{Research and Alternate Solutions}
A significant part of the planning phase for the project consisted of research. Two areas which required research were identified:
\begin{description}
\item[Domain knowledge:] No member of the group had any familiarity with the application domain, neither with the specific domain (fall studies) nor any of the related domains (like healthcare, medicine or sport science). A basic understanding of the domain is critical for communication with the expert group, as well as for the ability to develop and assess solutions independently of the expert group.
\item[Related software:] Related applications function as sources of inspiration, proofs of what is feasible to implement or even as aids during programming. Open source software can be partially or entirely incorporated into the code. Knowledge of related software can thus increase development efficiency.  
\end{description}
For each of the two areas of research, one member of the group was assigned to research and compile a concise report, so that the rest of the group could efficiently attain the required knowledge.   

The two reports will be reproduced in the following sections.
