\section{Meetings with Customer and Supervisor}
The main essence of the project was that it is based on the principle of the incremental working model. Thus include that the project needs regularly being updated by the stakeholding instances(customer,supervisor) for requirements and functionality. For this reason meetings between the group and the customer has to be made regularly every friday with the customer and every second monday with supervisor.   From that principles the project benefits in many aspects: - The project gains current updates - The progressing of the project is consistent - The project has the chance of getting feedback before and after the tasks are done - The project is splitted in small pieces of actionable specific smaller tasks - This smaller elements can be discussed in way being realistic or not quite before they are started - Due to the smaller pieces progress and mistakes can be backtracked - A way of working close for satisfying the customer - The group can react when the supervisor or customer are not understanding the interim results.
