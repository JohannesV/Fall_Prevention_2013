\section{Meetings with customer and supervisor}
Weekly meetings with the customer took place every Friday, as explained above. Also, meetings with the supervisor were conducted every second week.

The meetings had several positive effects:
\begin{itemize}
\item The project stakeholders were kept up-to-date.
\item The progress of the project was predictable.
\item The developers got feedback before and after the tasks are done.
\item The project was split in small pieces of actionable and specific tasks.
\item These smaller elements were discussed and considered before they were started.
\item Due to the smaller pieces of progress, mistakes were backtracked with a minimum of wasted work.
\item Customer got to participate in the development.
\item The group could take action when the supervisor or customer gave feedback on the results.
\end{itemize}
