\section{Meetings with Customer and Supervisor}
The main essence of the project was that it was based on an incremental working model. Because of this, the project need of regular updates by the stakeholder instances(customer,supervisor) for requirements, functionality and documentation. For this reason meetings between the group and the customer took place every Friday with the customer, and every second week with the supervisor.   
From these principles the project benefited in many aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item The project stakeholders were kept up-to-date
\item The progress of the project was predictable
\item The developers got feedback before and after the tasks are done
\item The project is split in small pieces of actionable and specific smaller tasks
\item These smaller elements can be discussed and considered before they are started
\item Due to the smaller pieces of progress, mistakes can be backtracked with a minimum of wasted work
\item Customer gets to participate in the development
\item The group can take action when the supervisor or customer gives feedback on the results
\end{itemize}
