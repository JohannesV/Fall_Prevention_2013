\section{Meetings with Customer and Supervisor}
Weekly meetings with the customer took place every Friday, as explained above. Also, meetings with the supervisor were conducted every second week.

The meetings had several positive effects:
\begin{itemize}
\item The project stakeholders were kept up-to-date
\item The progress of the project was predictable
\item The developers got feedback before and after the tasks are done
\item The project is split in small pieces of actionable and specific smaller tasks
\item These smaller elements can be discussed and considered before they are started
\item Due to the smaller pieces of progress, mistakes can be backtracked with a minimum of wasted work
\item Customer gets to participate in the development
\item The group can take action when the supervisor or customer gives feedback on the results
\end{itemize}
