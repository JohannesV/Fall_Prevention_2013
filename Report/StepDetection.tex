\chapter{Step Detection Algorithm}

\section{Development Process}
As the group had little experience in sensor use and signal processing, a series of experiments were conducted to better understand which sensors provide useful information for step detection, and which patterns predicate steps. To this end, a simple app was developed to observe sensor input and store the raw data as a file, which then could be transferred to a computer. A set of python scripts were written to plot  the data time series. Using python, a series of experiments with step detection algorithms was conducted, leading to a prototype.
