\subsection{Data model}
The data model describing the database handled by the Content Provider was mainly made to hold two types of information: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The time and number of steps, accomplished by storing receiving timestamps, and
\item The results and types of other tests, as results from other tests would also be a meaningful factor in some cases.
\end{enumerate}
This is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:CPDataModel}.
