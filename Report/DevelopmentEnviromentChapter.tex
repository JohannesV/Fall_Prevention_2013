\chapter{Development Environment}

\section{LaTeX}
LaTeX was used to write this report. LaTeX is a typesetting language, with support for varied formatting, including images and including other document. It also has the option allowed for inclusion of multiple LaTeX documents (.tex documents). This leads to improved readability of LaTeX code and productivity, as several chapters could be altered at the same time.This functionality allows a group of multiple users to avoid the problems associated with multiple users writing in the same document.
\section{Github}
It was requested by the customer that the group use the tool Github to share code and perform version control. Github had browser-based interfaces, download-able clients, and a robust command-line interface, meaning all the members of the group could make use of it. There were some problems associated with learning how to use and fix problems with it, as not all group members had experience with these tools. 

\section{Eclipse with Android Development Tools Plugin}
The demands from the Integrated Development Enviroment(IDE) was as following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Had support for programming applications for Android
\item Was understood by at least some members of the team
\end{itemize}
To fill these requirements, and because there was plenty of tutorials that could be found, the group decided to use the Eclipse IDE, with add-on's to more easily code and deploy towards Android.
