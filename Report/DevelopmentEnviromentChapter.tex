It also has the option allowed for inclusion of multiple LaTeX documents (.tex documents). This leads to improved readability of LaTeX code and productivity, as several chapters could be altered at the same time.This functionality allows a group of multiple users to avoid the problems associated with multiple users writing in the same document.

\label{def:githubDev}It is requested by the customer that the group use the tool Github to share code and perform version control. Github has browser-based interfaces, download-able clients, and a robust command-line interface, meaning all the members of the group can make use of it. There ere some problems associated with learning how to use and fix problems with it, as not all group members has experience with these tools.
