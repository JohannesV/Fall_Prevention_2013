\chapter{Development Environment}

\section{Code-sharing}
It was requested that the group would use the tool Github to share code and perform version control. Github had browser-based interfaces and downloadable clients, meaning all the members of the group could make use of it. \\
The repository that was to be used for the project was called "Fall\_Prevention\_2013". The first content shared in the repository was this report, in form of .tex files and a .pdf. Later this repository would also be used to keep the code in order. 

\section{IDE}
The demands from the IDE was as following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Could be used with Android programming
\item Was sufficiently understood by the team members to be used
\end{itemize}
To fill these requirements, and because there was plenty of tutorials that could be found, the group decided to use the Eclipse IDE, with add-on's to more easily code and deploy towards Android. 

\section{Prototyping}
Graphical prototyping was done with a service called "proto.io" and with paper scetches. The scetches were subsequently shown to the group and the customer.
