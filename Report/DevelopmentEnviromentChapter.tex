\chapter{Development Environment}


\section{Github}

\label{def:githubDev}It is requested by the customer that the group use the tool Github to share code and perform version control. Github has browser-based interfaces, download-able clients, and a robust command-line interface, meaning all the members of the group can make use of it. There were some problems associated with learning how to use and fix problems with it, as not all group members had experience with this tool. 

\section{Eclipse with Android Development Tools Plugin}
The demands from the Integrated Development Environment(IDE) are as following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Has support for programming applications for Android
\item Is understood by at least some members of the team
\end{itemize}
To fulfill these requirements, and because there are a plenty of tutorials that can be found, the group decides to use the Eclipse IDE, with add-on's for easier code and deploy towards Android.
