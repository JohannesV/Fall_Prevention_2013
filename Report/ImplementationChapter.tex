\chapter{Implementation}
\section{Plans}

The implementation used a iterative approach, where every sprint added a new layer of functionality, either to the application or the underlying model. Each sprint lasted for a period of 1-2 weeks, and the exact content was worked out in collaboration with the customer. Short term plans were favored over longer plans, due to the flexibility provided. While this made formulating definite goals for the final product difficult, the customer and the group were in agreement that due to the research intensive nature of the project, a high degree of flexibility was required. 

Nearing the end of every spring, the customer and group agreed upon the content of the following sprint. 

LA TABELL: + TIDSPUNKT
Sprint 1: Developing user stories and paper prototypes of the GUI.
