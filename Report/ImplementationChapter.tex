\section{Overall Architecture}
The product has been implement as a system of independent component applications where each component performs a well-defined task. The motivation behind the modular architecture is two-fold: Primarily, it was desirable that the underlying model for movement and fall risk be independent of the proof-of-concept application, in order to facilitate development of possible future applications employing the model. Likewise, it is desirable to enforce independence between the content provider and the sensor model. Secondly, the standards of Android application development state that a Content Provider should in itself solely provide a interface to the data. This implies that the sensor model, as well as any derivation of secondary data, should be performed in components independent of the Content Provider.

The system that has been designed according to these principles therefore consists of five components: The content provider emph{Valens Content Provider}, the proof-of-concept application emph{Valens Health Helper}, the sensor model emph{Valens Step Detector} and a service of deriving secondary data emph{Valens Content Feeder}. Each of these components fulfils a well-defined role in the total application system: The content provider provides an interface to the data model. The sensor model listens to the sensor data, and feeds the content provider with the timestamps of any detected steps. The Content Feeder listens continually to changes to the data in the content provider. When the data changes, it uses the new data to calculate secondary data, such as gait speed and variability. Finally, the proof-of-concept application demonstrates one simple way in which the data provided by the content provider can be used as a part of a health-promoting app.

\section{Architecture of the App}
The application is made in a way that is common for all android applications. This means that user interface is described in XML layout files that is called in Java code. Strings and resources is placed in a separate folder and file, to be accessed by the code as needed. This is to separate content and layout in the UI. The separation of layout and strings enables different localizations, so that the application can provide a user interface in different languages easily.

As is common in android applications, classes that inherit from the class Activity define a separate screen in the GUI. Because of this, a significant part of all the classes in the application are activity classes. These classes simply define the behaviour of their GUI screen. The flow for the GUI can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:FlowchartGUI}

Classes that are not activities can be roughly divided into 4 types: Data structure classes, auxiliary classes, connectivity classes, widget classes. Data structure classes simply define a useful data structure in the program. The data structure classes in the app are Event, ContactPerson and RiskStatus. Auxiliary classes help the activities perform their tasks. Most common among these are the adapters that define how elements should be shown in a list view. Connectivity classes are responsible for communicating with the database and content providers. There are two connectivity classes: DatabaseHelper, which does all the work, and DatabaseContract, which specifies the table and column names in the database. While a DatabaseContract might seem redundant, it is common android application practice to use one. Finally, there are the widget classes. WidgetProvider creates the widget and gives it a GUI. WidgetUpdateService is started by the WidgetProvider and takes care of updating the widget when changes happen in the content provider.

\section{Architecture of the Content Provider}
In android, Content Providers provide an interface to structured data of some sort. Access to for instance the list of contacts in the phone, or the phone's calendar is managed through standard content providers. Content Providers provide methods for inserting, updating and deleting relevant data. A major part of the assignment was to implement a Content Provider that gives developers access to structured movement data.

The Content Provider component is conceptually very simple, and consists of four classes:
\begin{description}
\item[CPValensDB]
a subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper, the standard android class for handling database communication. Specifies the procedure for creating the database, as well as upgrading and downgrading the database version. In the current implementation, upgrading and downgrading the database version clears all the data and tables, and creates the database according the details specified in the new database version. In the current version, creating the database consists of creating the tables given in the data model, without feeding any data into the database.
\item[DBSchema]
defines the database model and provides string values for the names of the tables and fields. Employing a database schema to demonstrate the structure of the database is standard in android applications.
\item[ValensDataProvider]
a subclass of ContentProvider, which is the standard android class for implementing content providers. This is the core of the content provider, and describes how queries to the content provider are handled.
\item[Main]
provdides the content provider with a basic GUI.

\section{Class description and diagram}

The class structure of the Applications changed regularly, and the most recent description is in Figure \ref{fig:ClassDiagram}. Older diagrams and descriptions was placed in the appendix.

\section{Architecture of the Valens Step Detector}

Despite being a relatively simple application in terms of lines of code and GUI screens, the architecture of Valens Step Detector has a certain complexity.

\begin{description}

\item[LaunchActivity]
handles the basic GUI for the main screen.

\item[Values]
holds the values of the constants used for step detection.

\item[Methods]
contains most of the functions used for calculation of peaks.

\item[StepMainService]
is main class for the sensor model. Is implemented as an Android Service, and as such, it runs in the continually in the background until the user explicitly stops it. Functions as a SensorListener that listens to input from the accelerometer, and keeps track of the sensor vector lengths along with their timestamp. When enough data has been generated\footnote{Enough data is defined as $m+2k+2n$, where k is the size of the smoothing window, n is the size of the peak strength window, and m is a constant which defines how many time steps one wants to use for step detection. As the first and last $k+n$ steps are not used for step detection (see explanation of the algorithm), only $m$ values will actually be used for step detection.} the StepMainService will launch a DetectStepsThread to detect steps in the given data, before clearing its data\footnote{For reasons that will be explained in the description of the algorithm, $2k+2n$ data points are retained.} to ensure that the maximum memory required by the service remains constant. 

\item[DetectStepsThread]
searches asynchronously for steps in the data provided to it. Step detection is performed in a separate thread so that sensor input is not interrupted by the calculation.

\item[Calibration Classes]
are a group of classes that are used for calibration, that is adjusting the mean and standard deviation to the step patterns of the user. There is one GUI class, one class used for timing and and one sensor class:
\begin{description}
\item[CalibrationActivity]
handles the GUI functions for the calibration screen. When the "calibrate"-button is pressed, it starts a timer that starts the CalibrationStartTask after a certain amount of time has passed, so that the user has time to lock the screen and put the phone in his/her pocket.
\item[CalibrationStartTask]
is a TimerTask that simply plays a sound to indicate that calibration commences, and immediately starts an CalibrationThread. This class only exists because Java requires a TimerTask for the Timer to work properly, and CalibrationActivity can't inherit from TimerTask as it already inherits from Activity and Java does not support multiple inheritance. 
\item[CalibrationThread]
handles sensor input during calibration. When the calibration time has ended, it stops receiving input, calculates $\mu$ and $\sigma$, and terminates.
