\section {How Tasks are assigned}
As a working plattform the group is using the website trello.com where the tasks are updated every week. Here tasks can be declared in a table of labeled with tasks "to do in future", "doing" and "done". The taskes in each column can be divided in smaller pieces with checkboxes and attached to the group members.
