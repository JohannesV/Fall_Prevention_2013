\subsection {How Tasks are assigned}
After WBS, tasks were uploaded to Trello. In theory, every member would pick the tasks he was most interested in, without any involvement of the group leader. However, because there were often students missing from the meetings, and these failed to choose tasks independently, the group leader was often required to assign some tasks. Tasks related to documentation were assigned by the document organizer rather than the group leader.

Communication between the group members throughout the week enabled reallocation of tasks from members that were not able to work as much as required or had gotten tasks that took longer than expected.
