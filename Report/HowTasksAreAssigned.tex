\subsection {How Tasks are assigned}
As a working platform the group is using the website trello.com where the tasks are updated every week. Here tasks can be declared in a table of labeled with tasks "to do in future", "doing" and "done". This is done by Elias, although all group members could ask to work on one part in particular. When the work is done, it is reported back to the board on trello, and a new task can be assigned.
