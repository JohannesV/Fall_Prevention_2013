\subsection {How Tasks are assigned}
The group were using the working platform Trello from their website\footnote{https://trello.com/}, where the tasks are updated every week. Here tasks can be declared in a table of labeled with tasks "to do in future", "doing" and "done". This was done by the project manager and the document-organizer, see \ref{def:the group}, although all group members could ask to work on one part in particular. When the work was done, it was reported back to the board on trello, and a new task was assigned.
