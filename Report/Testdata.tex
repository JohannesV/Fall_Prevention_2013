\subsection{Informal usability test}
During the meeting with the medical experts, the group gave an small and informal usability test to the two experts. 

\textbf{Prototype test}\\
\textbf{Subjects: Beatrice \& Jorunn}
\\

\subsubsection{Procedure}
This test was mainly focused on how intuitive it was to navigate the application system and how easy it was to understand the data received by the system. The procedure for this was to give the test subject a phone with program installed. They would then be asked to accomplish a few short tasks, and the observers would rate how easy the subject accomplished the tasks. 

\subsubsection{Results}
The data received from the system was easy to spot and easy to understand. The subjects had some difficulty finding the menu button for the first time, but had no problems with using it later on. It was overall relatively easy to navigate the system. However, the complexity was likely to be a bit too much for the target group.

\subsection{Acceptance testing and deployment}
During the end of the project, the customer expressed a desire to do acceptance testing on the application. The application was deployed on a web site \footnote{\url{http://valens.brennhe.it/}} along with instructions for installation and a form to give feedback. There was not much feedback, but the customer did send a mail with feedback, which is included in Appendix \ref{appendix:testResults}.
