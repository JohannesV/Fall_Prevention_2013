\section{Learning experiences from development and tool use}
Following are things that relate to project management and software development that the group learned during the project:
\begin{itemize}
 \item  It is important to ensure that documentation is done in a systematic fashion. In the beginning, a large amount of the reports and documentation that the group made for internal use, turned out to create more work and confusion later on. This was in part because it was not thought to be necessary at the time. Looking back, it seems like it would have been much more efficient to write reports well, and write them in LaTeX  while they were still new.
 \item Communication and what tools to use, was in flux for some time. Even when a few tools were settled on, the group still had problems with making sure all the members were on the same page regarding what needed to be done. 
 \item  Usage of tools which not all members were equally experienced with turned out to be problematic. This was because of misunderstanding and difficulties which could often be resolved by only one or two members, and slowed down the entire group. This might have been mitigated if all the members had a better understanding of the tools that were used. This could be accomplished by teaching sessions and group members being encouraged to seek a better understanding on their own.
 \end{itemize}
