\section{Alternate Solutions}
There was several other open source programs and commercial programs used to solve related problems. In some cases the team could import and make use of the open source programs, and in others the team could be inspired by design and well-made interfaces and functions. Here is the report, included as written:

\section{Research Reports}
Fields that the team had little experience with was researched by one or two members, who wrote a summary for the rest of the team. The content of these reports was a part of the project, and therefor it was appropriate to include them.
