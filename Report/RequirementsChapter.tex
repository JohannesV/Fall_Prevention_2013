\chapter{Requirements}
The requirements for the different parts of the project were about the requirements for the application, the underlying model and content provider, and the documentation for the model and content provider. 

\section{General requirements}
The requirements presented by the customer at the beginning of the project can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item A model for fall risk assessment based on sensors in Android phones should be developed.
\item The model should be accessible through a Content Provider.
\item The model should be accompanied by a proof-of-concept demo application.
\item The product should be available as open source through the Apache 2.0 license, explained below.
\item Development should follow an incremental approach.
\end{itemize}

\section{Elaborating on the requirements}
The initial requirements were too vague to base an implementation on, so the group worked on specifying the requirements further, in cooperation with the customer and later the health experts. The list of more precise requirement is presented below:

\subsection{Functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item A standard Android content provider should provide an interface to the generated risk data. The data model should contain enough details to be able give at least a basic predication of fall risk. The data model should include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gait speed - One of two major predicators of fall risk
\item Gait variability - The other major predicators of fall risk
\item Step count - A general measurement of health and activity level.
\end{itemize}
\item An example application should the developed. The demo application should:
\begin{itemize}
\item Appear as a health assistant, not as an application for fall risk assessment, as the elderly are reluctant to admit they have a risk for falling, and would not use such an application.
\item Provide useful information for people without a computational background. This way the health people can assess the usefulness of the model without having to learn the computational details.
\end{itemize}	
\end{itemize}	

\subsection{Nonfunctional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Development should be done in short iterations, and results should be presentable at each weekly customer meeting.
\item The demo application should be easy to use, even for elderly people unfamiliar with electronic equipment.
\item The application system should be modular and well-documented, so that it is easy to implement new applications based on the content provider, as well as connect new data sources to the content provider.
\end{itemize}	


\section{Understanding the requirements}

The requirements were specified after several meetings with the customer. The understanding the group had of the requirements before meeting the customer was not sufficient to create a rigorous set of requirements. Also, the requirements presented at the beginning of the project were vague, and needed more elaboration as the project progressed. \\

The meetings with the customer served their purpose, and filled in a lot of holes that were missing from the preliminary description for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item In the beginning the development process used an incremental approach. This essentially means that the requirements expands as the time goes, and to define the requirements from the beginning was therefore impossible.
\item Some of the requirements needed domain knowledge to be completely specified, and thus could not be set before the meeting with the health experts.
\item The customer expected weekly meetings with the whole group present, and that goals had been achieved before each meeting. At each meeting a new goal was set. Later, however, the development process changed, and longer term goals and requirements could be formulated. 
\end{itemize}

\section{License}
The results of the project was intended to be released under the Apache 2.0 license. It is an open source license, which can be found  at the following web site: \url{http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html}\\
Highlights of what can, cannot and must be done under the license is described here:\\

%\section{Testing}
%The tests were done by the black-box principle of testing, meaning that all the tests consider is, with no attention given to the inner workings of the methods. Because of the team following an agile development method, it was possible to create and test test-cases in short order. The test-cases were therefore written with results included.
%The tests are corresponding screens for the tests were as follows:
%\begin{description}
%\item[Name Entry] is associated with tests 1.x, both when program is started the first time, and when name-change is initiated from settings.
%\item[Event Details Screen] is associated with tests 2.x.
%\item[Statistics Screen] is associated with tests 3.x.
%\item[Clear history] can be initiated from settings screen and is associated with tests 4.x.
%\item[Related people Screen] is associated with tests 5.x.
