\chapter{Requirements}
\section{Initial requirements}

According to the project description, the following should be developed:
\begin{itemize}
\item A model of physical movements based on common movement sensors found in Android smart phones.
\item An Android content provider that stores and makes available the data in this model through an API\footnote{Application Programming Interface} .
\item An example application that can visualize this data.
\end{itemize}

\section{Understanding the requirements}

The group entered the project with a narrow understanding of what should be done, because the description was very general. Hence the general description, a meeting with the customer was arranged to get a broader explanation of what the project contains.\\
The meeting served its purpose and filled in a lot of holes that was missing from the official description:
\begin{itemize}
\item The development process in question uses a iterative approach. This essentially means that the requirements expands as the time goes, and to define the requirements from the beginning is impossible. This chose was made in collaboration with the customer.
\item The team at Sintef got a wide range of experts to help the group with health-specific features, e.g. making the algorithms to recognize movements.
\item The customer expected weekly meetings with the whole group present, and that goals had been achieved before each meeting. At each meeting a new goal until next meeting was set.
\end{itemize}
