\section{Understanding of requirements}

After first meeting with the customer we were told that we should not create a requirement specification right away because of the
way that the customer would like to work. The customer favours agile methods where the specification changes as we go along, and 
hence makes it difficult to write that much about.

But, from the project description we have that the students (we) will develop:
- A model of physical movements based on common movement sensors found in Android smart phones.
- An Android content provider that stores and makes available the data in this model through an API (content provider API).
- An example application that can visualize this data.

Our first requirements is to create scenarios for the overall product and paper mockups of the example application.
